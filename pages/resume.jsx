          I am a passionate computer engineer with a strong focus on software
          development and artificial intelligence. My experience spans a wide
          range of programming languages, from Python and JavaScript to Java,
          Kotlin and C. I have worked on web and mobile application projects,
          which has given me a solid understanding of today&apos;s most relevant
          technologies, like Next.js and TypeScript. My main goal is to create
          innovative and effective solutions that improve people&apos;s lives.

              My responsibilities primarily focused on frontend development,

              user experiences. Additionally, I collaborated on backend
              development, providing me with a comprehensive view of the
              development cycle. I integrated sales and payment APIs to enhance
              application functionality, resulting in a smoother and more
              efficient user experience.

              I participated in a project that consisted of developing a drone
              capable of flying autonomously by detecting data in real time. I
              worked on the creation of test scenarios and the implementation of
              machine learning models that would allow the drone to detect and
              react to different situations.

              I helped develop Java software that allowed stores to manage their
              inventory and track sales. We used technologies like PrimeFaces,
              HTML, and CSS for the user interface, which made it easy for
              businesses to upload products and calculate sales earnings.
